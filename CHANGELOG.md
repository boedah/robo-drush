## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [4.1.0] - 2018-09-11

### Added

- possibility to test multiple drush versions

## [4.0.0] - 2018-09-11

Since people might have shell escaped these parameters already,
this version is a new major as it is potentially backwards incompatible. 

### Changed

- `accountPass` and `dbSuPw` in site install command are now shell escaped 

## [3.1.1] - 2017-08-21

### Added

- support for the upcoming Drush 9 (only use `drush version` to get the version)

### Added

- support for `config-dir` property

## [3.0.2] - 2017-02-01

### Changed

- consolidation/robo dependency to `~1`

## [2.2.1] - 2015-11-27

### Changed

- Robo dependency to `>=0.5.2`, which means all future versions. As Robo is in pre-1.0 stage, this seems to make sense.

### Added

- second parameter `assumeYes` (default `true`) to `exec()`

## [2.1.0] - 2015-02-27

### Fixed

- PSR-4 autoloading (renamed `Drush.php` to `DrushStack.php`
- PHPUnit deprecation warning

## [2.0.2] - 2015-02-21

You have to use `"codegyre/robo": "dev-master"` in your composer.json,

- strict warning about 'same property'

## [2.0.1] - 2015-01-25

### Fixed

- Robo version in `conflict` section of composer.json

## [2.0.0] - 2015-01-25
